# VCV Rack Plugin Development - The DanT Method (on Windows 11)

This repository documents every step involved in setting up the development environment and then
editing code, committing changes, building the plugin and making a release for my VCV Rack plugin
DanTModules. It exists so that if I take an extended break from development, or need to format my
PC or migrate to a new PC, I will have a check list to ensure I don't forget any previous knowledge,
but it can also serve as a step-by-step guide for beginners that want to create their own VCV Rack
plugin and who don't mind following my opinionated example.

* Setup
  * [Step 1 - Install & Configure all the things](step_1.md)
  * [Step 2 - Git repository](step_2.md)
* Actual development cycle
  * [Step 3 - C++ time, edit-build-test, commit changes](step_3.md)
  * [Step 4 - Push, GitHub actions, making a release, library ready?](step_4.md)
  * GOTO Step 3
